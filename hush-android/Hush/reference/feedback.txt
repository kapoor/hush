v 1.0.1

It may be a good idea to explain in the App what "anonymously" means. Does it mean that my name won't be
published or does it have to do with facebook identity? Also does it mean the data won't be stored in
the facebook servers etc. For a naive user like me - these things matter to decide if the App is
really meant for me!
